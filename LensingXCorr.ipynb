      "The kappa map is already windowed due to the application of $w_c(\\mathbf{x})$ on the CMB map before reconstruction. Since the reconstruction is effectively a 2-pt function of the maps $\\langle XY \\rangle$ , the kappa map is distributed after dividing by $\\langle w_c^2(\\mathbf{x}) \\rangle$. This means that if you cross-correlate with another field $G$ that does not have any window applied, you should get an unbiased estimate.\n",
